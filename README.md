ProjectTheBox
=============

This is a project I have done with a teammate while I was at Koc University for on year.

It is intended to be a management system for a DVD rental store company that can have different stores.

This includes a database system:
  - Oracle 10g

And an application layer:
  - Java

I mostly did the Java part of the project.

Parts I hate about the project is that I had to put some logic code in GUI code, but we had to hack it to finish on time.
